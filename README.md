# Rockamendation

## Rockamendation is a website that lets the user choose their climbing level and location and a list of rock climbing locations based on both criteria. Also, the user can look at interesting data about each location. For example, if they hover over the Rockamendaiton, the user will be presented with data about successful climbers based on height and weight against the climbing levels.

### This website will be open to the most hardened climbing veteran and beginner climbers. The goal of the website is to get anyone interested in climbing an opportunity to find the best location.

### I will be working in partnership with one of the best Data engineers at ZipCode Wilmington Kristina Chiev (she goes by Thina). I will communicate with the database she has created to provide the recommendation list and present correlation graphs for the user. 

### Getting a list of recommendations will make it easier for climbers to make an informed decision on their next climb and have a rockin’ day.

### I’ll be doing this project using Spring, Java, and SQL DB, and for the front end, I will be using React.
